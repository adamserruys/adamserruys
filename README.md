<h1>Hello! My name is Adam.</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>A software engineer that is interested in helping organizations solve their problems and achieve their goals through code.  I love working with others as a team to solve a problem. I have an open mind to all ideas and enjoy learning from others.  My goal is to not only glean knowledge from others, but to contribute something to the collaborations that I am a part of.</p>

<h2>Current Tech Stack</h2>
<p>These days I spend time coding in React (primarily using Next.js), Node.js, and some plain old Javascript.  I'm hoping to make some time in the near future to learn TypeScript</p>

<h2>Other things I enjoy outside of coding</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Hanging with my wife and kids</li>
  <li>Trying to wrangle Maple and Pearl, my two crazy maltipoos</li>
  <li>Playing guitar</li>
  <li>Reading books that I can barely comprehend</li>
</ul>
